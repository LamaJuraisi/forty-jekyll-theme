Hi there! I’m Lama, a business analyst passionate about using data to drive insights and make a real impact. Throughout my career, I’ve worked on projects that blend strategic analysis with technical skills, like data visualization and automation.

In this portfolio, you’ll see some of my key projects and insights gained along the way, from consulting internships to data-driven analyses. Whether it's creating dashboards, analyzing market trends, or building strategies, I’m always excited to share the impact data can make.
